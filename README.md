# Ruby on Rails : A sample application

This application is the final project for the [Ruby on Rails class](http://www3.austincc.edu/it/cms/www/catalog/coursedetails_fox.php?year=2016&deptcode=COIS#ITSE1394) that I took at Austin Community College in the Fall of 2015.  I got an A!

Quite a bit of it is derived from [*Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).
